      It would be fascinating to own a game studio one day, but, for now, I would love to become a professional programmer.

    <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
    <p>
      Lately, I have been listening to lots of progressive music which helps me focus during coding. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC14ap4T608Zz_Mz4eezhIqw">The Grand Sound</a> is a popular youtube channel which I visit quite often.
